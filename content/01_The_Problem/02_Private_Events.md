Examples of private events include:

 * A Birthday party
 * A Family gathering
 * A Tech Conference
 * A Corporate Event
 * A School FÃªte

There are currently no mediums for the people attending such an event to collaborate on the happenings within the event, assembling in real-time a timeline & map including images, videos and other media.

The photo album is the old-school solution, except its value is only archival. And usually, it only consists of images from one member of the event, yet there are no-doubt many pieces of media and much insight that goes underutilised.

A medium that brings together all impressions of the event from all participants is hugely lacking.

### Real-time monitoring

Many of these types of events can be very large and can happen over a number of days. As such there are bound to be smaller occurrences (sub events) that are note-worthy within the scope of the main event itself.

A tech-conference, for example, needs to be able to manage the movements and actions of a vast number of audience members. Doing so via a pre-assembled schedule is sometimes insufficient. It would be nice to be able to communicate a change of plan or an important cancellation or addition via a centralised stream. Furthermore, emergent events, such as guest appearances or after-parties, would very much benefit from a collaborative stream where participants could share their insight and media.
