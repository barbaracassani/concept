Imagine a platform where you can discover and monitor events spanning the entire spectrum of human interest. Imagine having at your finger tips the power to know what's happening, here, within a mile, within your town, within your country. Anything of public significance. A fire causing traffic hold-ups. A food market event round the corner. Anything that touches, in both good and bad ways, the lives of those surrounding you.

Now imagine a platform that allows you to centralise all the experiences of a family birthday, in photos, videos, tweets, and more ... all while owning every piece of content you provide and resting assured that your private content is secured. Imagine if you could do this without any of that information even touching the Internet.

Now imagine a platform that revolutionises online news media. Imagine tracking a news story, seeing information flowing in live from around the globe, media from people on the ground, facts and statistics as they emerge from history being made.
