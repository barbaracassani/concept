Yip is aiming for:

 * Collaborative Input, inspired by the Wiki/StackExchange models
 * A Centralised stream for any given event
 * Rich media, insights, tweets (*etc.) feeding into this stream
 * A timeline & mapping interface that has both real-time and archival value

*todo: improve these points*

Everything from the local and niche-specific to the global and far-reaching events. Contrast:

 * Northern Train Line Closure, 14:00 - 19:00. Bus replacement service running.

To this:

 * Snowden seeks asylum in Russia, Russia response awaiting...

To this:

 * Your friends are 

Seemingly nothing ties these two events together. But, in fact, they are both the same type of thing -- things happening right now that humans want to know about.

A platform that allows the reporting and discovery of all different types of events would be hugely beneficial to people in all walks of life.
