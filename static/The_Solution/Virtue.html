			<div><h1>The Solution: Virtue</h1></div><blockquote>
  <p>Make discoverable the pulse of the world, in your pocket.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The purpose of Yip is to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Provide humanity with a means to discover what matters</li>
<li>Enable crowd-sourced and transparent journalism</li>
<li>Reinvent streaming for private and public events</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Yip is an open-source effort to bring about a new way of reporting and discovering events in real-time.</p>

<p>We see the world lacking in a medium to convey and discover events. Events of all types, from entertainment and birthday parties to news-streams and disaster timelines.</p>

<p>Human lives are composed of events, large and small, and our effectiveness at recording and discovering these has been hugely lacking. An event is not just a Facebook Album, a Twitter stream, or a blog post. An event is a real-time slice of our lives bounded by a topical consistency and measured by its significance and positiveness. As such, humanity would greatly benefit from a free, open-source and all-encompassing medium for the reporting and archiving of these events.</p>

<h3>But why "open source" it?</h3>

<p>We want to open-source the concept and eventual software so that we can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Garner a truly passionate collective of contributors</li>
<li>Get key scrutiny of our privacy/security software practices</li>
<li>Provide the world with an infinitely useful piece of software with no commercial interests</li>
</ul>

<p>The concept is being developed in the open so that the it can benefit from being truly optimised and near-perfected before the software is released. There is no benefit in starting early down the wrong road; we'd rather pick the right road and take it slowly, keeping in mind our endeavour to create a platform that is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reliable to run; with minimised downtime &amp; bugs</li>
<li>Safe from vulnerabilities and privacy concerns</li>
<li>Perfected in its User Experience; giving users what they want</li>
</ul>
