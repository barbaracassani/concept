			<div><h1>The Problem: Private Events</h1></div><p>Examples of private events include:</p>

<ul>
<li>A Birthday party</li>
<li>A Family gathering</li>
<li>A Tech Conference</li>
<li>A Corporate Event</li>
<li>A School FÃªte</li>
</ul>

<p>There are currently no mediums for the people attending such an event to collaborate on the happenings within the event, assembling in real-time a timeline &amp; map including images, videos and other media.</p>

<p>The photo album is the old-school solution, except its value is only archival. And usually, it only consists of images from one member of the event, yet there are no-doubt many pieces of media and much insight that goes underutilised.</p>

<p>A medium that brings together all impressions of the event from all participants is hugely lacking.</p>

<h3>Real-time monitoring</h3>

<p>Many of these types of events can be very large and can happen over a number of days. As such there are bound to be smaller occurrences (sub events) that are note-worthy within the scope of the main event itself.</p>

<p>A tech-conference, for example, needs to be able to manage the movements and actions of a vast number of audience members. Doing so via a pre-assembled schedule is sometimes insufficient. It would be nice to be able to communicate a change of plan or an important cancellation or addition via a centralised stream. Furthermore, emergent events, such as guest appearances or after-parties, would very much benefit from a collaborative stream where participants could share their insight and media.</p>
